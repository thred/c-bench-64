    compilers Oscar64 and LLVM-mos have been added since.

<h2>Compilers</h2>

@for (key of compilerKeys; track key) {
    @if (compilers()[key]; as compiler) {
        <app-compiler [compiler]="compiler"></app-compiler>
    }
}

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>
    The benchmarks are based on the original GG Labs benchmarks and have only been slightly modified. All benchmarks
    were executed on a VICE emulator. The duration is measured by the emulated code itself, so the speed of the host
    system does not matter.

@for (key of benchmarkKeys; track key) {
    @if (benchmarkWithResultsMap()[key]; as benchmark) {
        <app-benchmark [key]="key"></app-benchmark>
