    compilers Oscar64 and LLVM-mos have been added since.

<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

<p>
    The benchmarks are based on the original GG Labs benchmarks and have only been slightly modified. All benchmarks
    were executed on a VICE emulator. The duration is measured by the emulated code itself, so the speed of the host
    system does not matter.
