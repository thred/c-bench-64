        "KickC is a C-compiler for 6502-based platforms creating optimized and readable assembler code. The language is 95% standard C with a few limitations and a few extensions.",
        "The compiler is written in Java. Unfortunately, it has severe restrictions (no multiplication or division) and thus compatibility issues with most benchmarks.",
        "The compiler does not support compiling each C-file individually and linking them later. Instead KickC insists on compiling all needed C-files in one go to be able to optimize better. It expects that there exists a `.c` file for each `.h` file. In fact, KickC does not need header files at all.",
        "It is not affiliated with the KickAssembler project but creates assembler code that is compatible with it."
